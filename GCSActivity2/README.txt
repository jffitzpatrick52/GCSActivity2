My name is John Fitzpatrick, and this is my submission for the GCS Coding Activity 2 assignment. This program was written in C.

SortAndFindMedian.c is the source code for this assignment. It uses a quick sort algorithm to sort an array of integers in place, then print and return the median value of that array. 

During testing, I compiled SortAndFindMedian.c with gcc.
